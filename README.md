# PomodoroTimer
This is threading practice problem. I implemented a [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) that executes task for 25 minutes and then ask user to give his/her choice to take a break. Based on the user choice it takes short break. I have two versions of the pomodoro timer - threaded version and another one is GUI version.

Dependancy- python 2.7 and Tkinter
